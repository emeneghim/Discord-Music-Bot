Since some Discord bots that played youtube music on group calls were blocked, I decided to code my own to my personal use.

The bot was developed in JavaScript and Node.JS. In order to the bot to work, it is needed to insert the node files and change the bot token according to your
own personal token (It can be replaced on the file index.js)
